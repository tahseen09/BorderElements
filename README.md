# BorderElements

### This question was asked to me during an interview, and I thought of a solution using recursion. The problem statement was, to print first the outer elements and then the inner elements in a certain fashion of a square matrix(2D array). 


## Example:

[ 1  2  3  4  5  ] <br>
[ 6  7  8  9  10 ]
[ 11 12 13 14 15 ]
[ 16 17 18 19 20 ]
[ 21 22 23 24 25 ]

Output: 1 2 3 4 5 10 15 20 25 24 23 22 21 16 11 6 7 8 9 14 19 18 17 12 13

### Note: My solution only worked for square matrices, not rectangular ones. Do raise a PR if you have better overall solution.
